Subject: Patient Update - Migraine Diagnosis and Treatment Plan

Dear [Doctor's Name],

I am writing to update you on the current status of our patient who presented with symptoms of severe headache and nausea. After conducting a thorough examination, I have made a diagnosis of likely migraine.

The patient's symptoms include:

* Severe headache
* Nausea

Based on this diagnosis, I have developed a treatment plan that includes:

* Pain relievers to alleviate the patient's headache and discomfort
* Rest to help manage the symptoms and promote recovery

I believe this treatment plan will help the patient to recover from the current episode and manage their symptoms effectively. I will continue to monitor the patient's progress and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns regarding this patient's diagnosis and treatment plan.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
